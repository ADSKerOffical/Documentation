CFrame and Vector3 are functions for moving objects
CFrame stores the position and orientation of an object
Vector3 only stores the position of the object
Therefore their property and needs will be different

For example a script that moves a local player through a CFrame:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = CFrame.new(20, 50, 10) -- moves around X, Y, Z
-- If you want to use Vector3 then put HumanoidRootPart.Position = Vector3.new(20, 50, 10)


You can also add new coordinates to other coordinates
Here is an example script:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Position = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Position + Vector3.new(0, 20, 0) -- Raises the local player up
-- If you want to use CFrame then put HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = HumanoidRootPart.CFrame * CFrame.new(0, 20, 0)


If you want to flip an object then use Orientation:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Orientation = Vector3.new(20, 190, 95) -- this is just an example, don't use it on the player
