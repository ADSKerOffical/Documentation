Hello everyone, and today in this file I will talk about Humanoid characters
                            Physical properties
Here is a regular script for speed:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 50 -- default 16


If you want to change the humanoid speed twice without knowing the current speed then you can use this:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed * 2


You can also use a script to change the jump strength:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.JumpPower = 100 -- default 50


But it won't work if you set humanoid.UseJumpPower = false
In this case you will either set it to true or use JumpHeight:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.JumpHeight = 25 -- default â‰ˆ10


Also you can change health, max health, hip height and so on
Here is an example of these scripts:


game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth = math.huge -- inf
game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.Health = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth
                                RootPart
